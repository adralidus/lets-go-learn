  # Fix RLS policy for examinations table

  1. Security Changes
    - Add policy to allow anon role to insert examinations
    - This is a temporary fix for development - production should use Supabase auth

  2. Important Notes
    - This allows unauthenticated users to create examinations
    - Should be replaced with proper Supabase authentication in production
    - Current custom auth system doesn't work with auth.uid() in RLS policies

-- Add policy to allow anon role to insert examinations
-- This is needed because the app uses custom auth instead of Supabase auth
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon to insert examinations"
  ON examinations
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also allow anon to update examinations (needed for editing)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anon to update examinations"
  ON examinations
  FOR UPDATE
  TO anon
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
